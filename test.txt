Hume
character trait to analyze: Responsibility
Intro:
	Use definition of personal merit
	key words: esteem and affection (respect and love) (65)
	
	Responsibility as a catch-all, fits the mold of Hume's three categories
	for character traits: useful, agreeable to ourselves, agreeable to others.
	
useful:

	responsible in a work environment means you make contributions to society. 

	And as the public utility of these virtues is the chief circumstance, whence they
	derive their merit, it follows, that the end, which they have a tendency to promote,
	must be some way agreeable to us, and take hold of some natural affection. It must
	please either from considerations of self-interest, or from more generous motives
	and regards. (68)
	
	It appears that a tendency to public good, and to the promoting of peace,
	harmony, and order in society, does always, by affecting the benevolent principles
	of our frame, engage us on the side of the social virtues

agreeable to ourselves:

	on top of our tasks at hand, know that the job doesn't always end at 5 and need to
	push the extra mile.  Satisfaction in our own work. 
	The preceding delineation or definition of Personal Merit must still retain
	its evidence and authority: it must still be allowed that every quality of the mind,
	which is useful or agreeable to the person himself or to others, communicates a
	pleasure to the spectator, engages his esteem, and is admitted under the honourable
	denomination of virtue or merit. (99)

agreeable to others:
	
	trustworthy
	Usefulness is agreeable, and engages our approbation. This is a matter of fact,
	confirmed by daily observation. But, useful? For what? For somebody's interest,
	surely. Whose interest then? Not our own only: For our approbation frequently 
	extends farther.  It must, therefore, be the interest of those, who are served by
	the character or action approved of; and these we conclude, however remote, are not
	totally indifferent to us. (70)  
	
	He has met with sever trials, misfortunes as well as dangers; and by his greatness
	of mind, was still superior to all of them (95)
	
conclusion:
hutcheson outline
intro:
	we as "rational agents" can discern immediate goods "pleasure" with the virtuous
	moral good (52)
	"they study the interest and desire the happiness of other beings with whom they
	converse" (53)

How does he do it?

	Uses definitions of moral good and natural goods to split the feelings
	"For let it be here observed, that those senses by which we perceive pleasure in
	natural objects, whence they are constituted advantageous, could never raise in us
	any desire of public good, but only what was good to ourselves in particular"
	
	APPEAL TO BEAUTY: 
	Temporal and Spatial distance can still be seen as good (54) "Peru mountains" (53)
	
	Appreciate beauty of benevlonce (54)
	
	APPEAL TO LOGIC:
	Separation from the natural goods: "That had we no sense of moral sense of natural
	good engage us always to the victorious side, and make us admire and love the 
	successful tyrant, or traitor?" (55)

	"Why don't we then approve both alike? It is plain we have some secret sense which
	determines our approation without regard to self-interest; otherwise we should
	always favour the forunate side without regard to virtue, and suppose ourselves
	engaged with that party" (55)

	APPEAL TO BIOLOGY:
	(Distinct pleasure) Bite into pleasant fruit, conscious of pleasure, 
	moral virtue not always	conscious, rather...
	"It is only by reflex acts upon our temper and conduct, that virtue never fails
	to give pleasure" (56,57)
	
	Can't just "suddenly be happy" by our own volition (58) As opposed to
	using natural goods on demand

	APPEAL TO PUBLIC GOOD: 
	the cardinal virtues = dispositions universally necessary to promote public good
	When unavoidable death befalls us,
	our concern for families friends and country remain (61)
